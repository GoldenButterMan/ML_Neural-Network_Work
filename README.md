# ML_Neural-Network_Work
This is a repository that contains my work using Python for both Machine Learning and Neural Networks. The files in this repository were used for my CPSC 499 Machine Learning Course during the Winter 2025 Semester at the University of Northern British Columbia.

Regarding the brain tumor neural network code, that was for a project for my CPSC 499 Course. It was a group project where I teamed up with Rowan Massad. The neural network code shown here is my part of the work done on the project before Rowan and I combined our work and cleaned it up for the final submission.
